Chapter Structure Prompt for Technical Writing
You are helping write chapters for a book aimed at mid-level software engineers. Each chapter should teach a clear lesson while being enjoyable to read. Use the following structure:
STRUCTURE TEMPLATE
1. INTRO HOOK STORY (~10-15% of chapter)

Open with a concrete, sensory micro-scene that shows the problem in action
Include tension, stakes, and use observer POV to create immersion
Show the problem's shape before naming the abstraction
Make it recognizable—readers should think "I've been in this exact meeting/situation"
Target: 600-800 words for a ~5,500 word chapter

Quality check: Could a reader who skims only this section immediately recognize the problem in their own work?
2. RESEARCH STORY / EVIDENCE FRAME (~15-20% of chapter)

Integrate 1-2 research studies (psychology, cognitive science, decision science, organizational behavior)
Bridge formal research findings to engineering practice
Choose research type strategically:

Diagnostic: Explains why the problem exists (validates reader's pain)
Mechanism: Explains why the solution works (builds confidence in tactic)
Counterintuitive: Challenges assumptions (creates "wait, what?" moments)


Translate academic findings into engineering consequences (e.g., "chunking reduces cognitive load" → "templates convert recurring decisions into pre-priced blocks")
Use narrative style—tell the story of the research, don't just cite it
Target: 800-1,000 words

FLEX OPTION: For some chapters, swap the order of Research and Lever sections if showing the tactic first, then explaining why it works, creates better flow.
Quality check: Would an engineer say "Oh, there's an actual mechanism here" rather than "this is just someone's opinion"?
3. THE LEVER (~5% of chapter)

Distill the core mechanism into a single tight paragraph
Use transformation language: "X converts to Y, which leads to Z"
Include a "pattern equation" when applicable (e.g., "Templates convert recurring decisions → pre-priced blocks → reduced variance")
This is aggressive compression—force yourself to crystallize the insight
Target: 250-300 words maximum

Quality check: Could someone read only this paragraph and explain the core idea to a colleague?
4. BODY: APPLICATION & EXAMPLES (~40-45% of chapter)

Provide 2-3 detailed worked examples or case studies
Include tactical playbook: when to apply, how to apply, step-by-step rituals
Cover common failure modes with brief fixes (not exhaustive—trust readers to extrapolate)
Optionally add 1 supporting anecdote that reinforces the mechanism
Use tables sparingly—only for truly scannable reference material (rituals, checklists, decision frameworks)
Avoid: exhaustive coverage, every edge case, reference material that belongs in appendices
Target: 2,200-2,500 words

Quality check: Could a reader take one tactic from this section and apply it Monday morning?
5. CLOSING HOOK (~5% of chapter)

Seed the next chapter's problem or opportunity
Make it feel like natural progression, not a cliffhanger
Frame as "Once you can do X, the next challenge becomes Y"
Should enhance continuity but not create dependencies (next chapter must stand alone)
Target: 250-300 words

Quality check: Does this create genuine curiosity without feeling manipulative?
6. FIELD NOTE [OPTIONAL] (~2-3% of chapter)

Single paragraph with the most important tactical takeaway
Conversational, personal tone
Often starts with "If you adopt only one thing from this chapter..."
Use when you want to land a final punch or provide a memorable anchor
Target: 100-150 words when used

Quality check: Is this the one thing you'd want a reader to remember six months from now?

WRITING GUIDELINES
Voice & Tone:

Write with the confidence of someone who's lived these problems, not lecturing
Use specificity to create recognition ("late afternoon glare flattening faces into silhouettes" not "a meeting room")
Stay frustrated with the reader about the problem, not at them
Avoid: emojis, excessive formatting, over-explaining after the mechanism is clear, "textbook" language

Compression Discipline:

If the body exceeds 45%, you're either teaching multiple lessons (split the chapter) or including reference material (move to appendix)
Trust your earlier sections—if Hook + Research + Lever did their job, readers already get it
Pick representative examples over comprehensive coverage

Research Integration:

Never dump citations—always bridge to "here's what this means when you're in a sprint planning meeting"
Use researcher names and study details for credibility, but keep the focus on practical implications
Acceptable to use phrases like "Research on X shows..." without full academic citation format

Tables & Formatting:

Use tables only when they aid scannability (checklists, rituals, decision matrices)
Keep tables in narrative flow to 2-3 maximum
Convert prose to tables when there are clear parallel structures to compare
Keep headers short and sentence-case

Target Length:

Total chapter: 5,000-6,000 words
Can flex up to 7,000 for complex topics, but edit ruthlessly


QUALITY GATES BEFORE FINALIZING

The 30-Second Test: Can someone skim Hook + Lever and walk away with the core idea?
The Standalone Test: If a reader skips previous chapters, does this one still make sense?
The Dinner Party Test: After reading, could someone explain ONE insight in under 60 seconds?
The Monday Morning Test: Can a reader take one concrete tactic and apply it this week?
The Binge Test: Does the Closing Hook create genuine curiosity for what's next?


EXAMPLE PATTERN EQUATION FORMATS

"Templates convert recurring decisions → pre-priced blocks → reduced variance"
"Decomposition forces private assumptions → shared artifacts → earlier alignment"
"Option matrices convert vague requests → explicit tradeoffs → transferred ownership"
"X breaks down into Y, which enables Z, resulting in [outcome]"

Use these as models for crystallizing mechanisms in The Lever section.
