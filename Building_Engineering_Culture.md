Why do I want to read this?

: Maybe you’ve felt like you were the one trying hardest on your team, caring more about the work or how things get done than others. It feels like you constantly have to jump in and finish tasks for others on the team but you don't know why they aren't as motivated as you.

What will I learn?

: You will learn how to identify the elements that make up strong engineering culture, how to influence culture even without formal authority, and how to introduce and reinforce practices that improve both code quality and team effectiveness over time.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?

: You'll be able to spot when engineering culture is working—or not—enfluence culture changes that actually last, and help build teams where solid engineering habits are just how things get done.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

: In the next chapter, we will explore architecting your career, which takes the principles of building culture and applies them to designing a career path that allows you to expand your influence.
