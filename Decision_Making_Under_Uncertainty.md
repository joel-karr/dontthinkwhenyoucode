Why do I want to read this?

: You’ve probably had to make technical decisions without all the details you wanted. It’s frustrating when people expect estimates or clear answers, but you don’t feel ready to give them. That pressure can make you second-guess yourself or worry about making the wrong decision.

What will I learn?

: You’ll pick up ways to make tech decisions when things are unclear, figure out what info you really need versus what’s just nice to have, and learn how to set things up so you can change your mind easily as you get new details.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?

: You’ll be able to make solid tech choices even when you don’t have all the answers, break down problems so things get clearer as you go, and set things up so your work can handle changes as new info comes in.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

: Next up, we’ll dig into requirements gathering. That’s where you learn how to ask the right questions and get to the heart of what actually needs solving—so you can cut down on uncertainty and make smarter decisions.
