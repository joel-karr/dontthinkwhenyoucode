# Adoption Playbook

## Goal
Move from isolated wins to durable, organization-wide practice without heroics.

## Adoption Curve Stages
| Stage | Signal | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Seed | 1-2 teams experimenting | Reduce friction |
| Prove | Measurable local wins | Capture metrics |
| Expand | Adjacent teams pull | Standardize templates |
| Normalize | Default behavior | Automate guardrails |
| Institutionalize | Embedded in onboarding | Continuous refinement |

## Levers
1. Visible Wins (before/after metrics dashboards)
2. Lightweight Onramps (starter repos, checklists)
3. Narrative Reinforcement (stories over mandates)
4. Champions Network (distributed advocates)
5. Feedback Channels (monthly pulse + issue tags)
6. Tooling & Templates (remove toil)

## Metric Set
- Cycle Time (idea → production)
- Defect Escape Rate
- Review Latency
- Template Reuse Count
- Onboarding Ramp Time

## Play Sequencing
1. Baseline (current metrics snapshot)
2. Pilot (select high friction domain)
3. Codify (extract reusable templates)
4. Broadcast (internal talk + doc update)
5. Enable (add to starter kits)
6. Monitor (dashboards + drift alerts)

## Drift Management
Quarterly audit: sample 5 recent features → score against playbook → gap actions.
Automate: linter / CI checks for required scaffolds (intent block, risk checklist).

## Example Rollout
Task Templates: seed on growth team → cut planning time 30% → publish mini case study → add to onboarding.

## Closing Bridge
With adoption mechanics in place, we can evolve culture & leadership layers (Building Engineering Culture next).
