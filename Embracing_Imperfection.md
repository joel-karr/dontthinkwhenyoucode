Why do I want to read this?

: Maybe you've spent a lot of time making your software perfect, adding lots of error logging and exception handling. But when it finally ships, it feels like it isn't appreciated and you don't get the win you expected. This chapter is about finding ways to deliver faster, without losing what matters.

What will I learn?

: You'll learn how to spot when you're slipping into gold plating—over-engineering beyond what's needed. We'll talk about how to weigh the real value of extra improvements against the time they cost, and how to ship in smaller steps without letting quality slip where it matters.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?

: You'll be able to recognize when you're chasing perfection that doesn't move the needle, make smarter calls about when to polish and when to ship, and put your energy into the parts of your work that actually make a difference for users and the business.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

: Next up, we'll dig into building engineering culture—how to spread smart habits and quality thinking across your whole team, so good decisions become the norm and not something you never have time for.
