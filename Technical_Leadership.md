Why do I want to read this?

: Maybe you've seen engineers who always seem to steer technical decisions and shape how things get built, even if they're not the boss. You're curious how you can build those technical leadership skills yourself—so you can help your team make better choices and have a real impact, no matter what your job title is.

What will I learn?

: You will discover what sets technical leadership apart from management, how to earn trust by demonstrating technical expertise, and how to guide technical decisions by communicating clearly and reasoning effectively, regardless of your official role.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?

: You'll be able to jump in and lead technical conversations, help shape architecture choices, support and mentor other engineers, and get people on board with good technical ideas—even if you're not the most senior person on the team.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

: In the next chapter, we will explore decision-making under uncertainty, which builds on the technical leadership foundation by addressing how to make sound engineering choices when you don't have complete information.
