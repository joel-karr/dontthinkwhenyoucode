Why do I want to read this?

: Maybe you've spent hours building something, only to find out it wasn't what anyone actually wantedâ€”or the requirements changed halfway through. This chapter is about figuring out what really needs to be built before you start coding, and learning how to ask the kinds of questions that get to the heart of what people actually need.

What will I learn?

: You'll learn how to pull real requirements out of vague requests, spot hidden assumptions and constraints, and guide conversations with stakeholders so you can uncover what actually needs solving.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?

: You'll be able to ask the right questions to turn ideas into clear technical specs, and help everyone agree on what "done" means---before anyone writes a single line of code. You'll also build stronger relationships with the product team and end users, so they'll include you earlier in brainstorming. This leads to less rework, better collaboration, and a more effective software engineering team.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

: When you understand the buisness goals and strategy, you can work more effectively with your team. In the next chapter we will learn how to create team shared mental models to avoid rework or gaps in functionality.

The weight of the question can be felt by everyone on the team. The product team is already bracing for pushback but they ask it anyways. How long will "IT" take?
