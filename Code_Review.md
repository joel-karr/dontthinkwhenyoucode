Why do I want to read this?

: Your code reviews feel like nitpicking sessions that slow down development without meaningfully improving code quality, and you struggle to give feedback that actually helps teammates grow.

What will I learn?

: How to approach code reviews as a chance to learn and grow together---using training and task templates to guide feedback. You'll see how reviews can fuel ongoing learning, build team skills, and keep code quality high without just focusing on fixing mistakes.

What will I be able to do that I couldn't do before?

: You will be able to conduct code reviews that are constructive and collaborative, helping your team improve their skills while maintaining high code quality. You'll learn to give feedback that is actionable and focused on learning rather than just pointing out errors.

Where are we going next, and how does this fit in?

: Code reviews help identify specific areas where your team can focus training and skill development, making it easier to target feedback and learning. In the next chapter, we'll explore how to motivate people with a larger vision and approach to building great products, moving beyond individual reviews to inspire broader growth and collaboration.
